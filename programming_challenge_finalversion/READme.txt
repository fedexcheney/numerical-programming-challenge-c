matmult_1 is usual c code file, since I am using m1 laptop, I would be very appreciate if you try my other files (neon, omp), because I'm not sure if they will be faster than this (on m3 laptop).

matmult_2 used apple accelerate gemm, this one has much faster GFLOP but it is probably unfair.

Finally, please choose the version that you accept and the fastest for the competition. Thank you!
